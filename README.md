# Sorting Algorithms Visualizer

A sorting visualizer made with Java Vanilla can be designed to demonstrate different sorting algorithms and their performance on different data sets. The project could involve creating a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to select a sorting algorithm , a data set size,the sorting speed and then visualize the algorithm's progress as it sorts the data. The GUI created using HTML, CSS  and the visualizations  be rendered using JS Vanilla.

The project include the implementation of several sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort and Quick Sort. The user interface have buttons for selecting the sorting algorithm and data set size, as well as a "Solve" button that begins the visualization.

The data sets used in the visualizer generated randomly by "Randomize" button. The visualizer represents the data as a set of bars, where each bar represents a single data value. As the sorting algorithm progresses, the visualizer can update the display to show the changes made to the data.

Overall, the sorting visualizer project can be a fun and educational way to learn about different sorting algorithms and how they work.
## Features
The Sorting Visualizer provides the following features:

-Randomize: Randomizes the input array to be sorted.
-Solve: Sorts the input array using the selected sorting algorithm.
-Array Size: Allows the user to adjust the size of the input array.
-Sorting Speed:Allows the user to adjust the speed of the selected algorithm.
-Sorting Algorithm: Allows the user to select the sorting algorithm to be used.
-Visual Representation: Provides a visual representation of the sorting process.
## Installation

To install the Sorting Visualizer, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Marwahaifawi/AlgorithmsVisualizer.git
Open the project in your preferred Java development environment.
## Usage
To use the Sorting Visualizer, follow these steps:

 1.Run the index.html file.

 2.Select the desired sorting algorithm from the drop-down menu.

 3.Adjust the size of the input array using the slider.

 4.Click the Randomize button to generate a random array.

 5.Click the Solve button to sort the array.

 6.Enjoy watching the visualizer sorting your array by applying  the choosen algorithms.
